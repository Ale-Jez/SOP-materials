## Structure and Navigation

The materials are organized by course and then by specific laboratory number. For each laboratory there are two main directories, such as:


- **Lab1**
  
  containing the actual lab task conducted in 2024/25 for *Computer Science and Information Systems* major
- **Lab1-Preparations**
   
   containing tasks used for me for preparations. It includes the code used during consultations (mostly based on lab tasks conducted in 2024/25 for *Informatyka i Systemy Informacyjne* major)

\
Each subdirectory should conatain the following files:

- `.c` files with code from different stages including the initial one

- `.pdf` file with task description

- `.jpg` files with task description if there's no pdf

- `Makefile` original Makefile provided by lab coordinators
